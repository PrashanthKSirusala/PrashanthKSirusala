- Hi, I’m Prashanth kumar Sirusala, a graduate in Cyber Security from Florida International University. Thanks for taking your time to read about me.
- During my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering(2017-2021), I have developed a keen interest towards cyber security after seeing most of fellow students developing their interest towards Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Web development. There are bunch of people throughout every domain, and I knew I wanted to learn something unique. Reaching out to one of my professors, that I wanted to learn about securing an organization, to participate in the secuirty operations, he suggested me that I first learn networking concepts, understand the behavior of the network in communication, I found multiple directories of networking concepts, and I put myself into learning. Unique (poor me did not know the importance of certifications).
- During covid, I approached one of my alumni working on developing an application called "WhatsApp Khushi" (https://khushiteluguapp.firebaseapp.com/), a social media application for telugu speaking people motivated to ease sharing media. Worked as an application development intern. Later, joined Mindtree Ltd in June 2020 as a cyber security analyst.
- After almost 2 years of working at Mindtree, I decided to skill up with a masters degree in cyber security, with admission into Florida International University, Miami I flew to the states in august 2022. And this has been a rewardful experience expecting to graduate May 2024.
- After securing an internship in January 2024, I was motivated towards to staying updated in the domain, and claiming the certifications the industry is looking for and actively applying for new roles.
  
- I have completed a series of certifications involving security operations including SOC Level 1 from tryhackme, Security operations center in practice from IBM, Google cyber security professional certification through coursera.
- I’m looking to collaborate on security research.
